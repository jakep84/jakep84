### ✨ What I Bring to the Table

- 🎯 I design and ship custom **AR, VR, AI, and simulation software** from scratch to production.
- 🧰 I engineer end-to-end systems in **Unity, Python, React, C++, and C#** — no fluff, just results.
- ⚡ I prototype fast, lead lean teams, and build with a bias toward bold execution.
- 🤝 I’ve worked across startups, defense, government, and frontier tech — and I’m just getting started.
